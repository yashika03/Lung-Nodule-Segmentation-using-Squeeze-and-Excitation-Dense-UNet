# Lung-Nodule-Segmentation-using-Squeeze-and-Excitation-Dense-UNet
In this project I have used LUNA-16 which consists of 888 CT scan images and this dataset is a subset of LIDC/IDRI dataset. 

## For the Pre-processing we have followed following steps:
1. Applying CLAHE
2. Binary Thresholding
3. Erosion amd Dilation
4. Filling Holes
5. Extracting lungs and nodule masks
